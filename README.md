# Netflix IMDb + RT Ratings (Stable)

This is a Tampermonkey userscript that displays **IMDb ‚≠ê** and **Rotten Tomatoes üçÖ** ratings directly on Netflix movie and series pages.

## Features
- Fetches ratings from the [OMDb API](https://omdbapi.com).
- No flicker when loading.
- Works on both preview modals and full pages.

## How it works
- The script detects the movie or show title currently being displayed on Netflix.  
- It then calls the **OMDb API** to retrieve ratings.  
- From the response, it extracts the **IMDb ‚≠ê rating** and the **Rotten Tomatoes üçÖ score** (if available).  
- These ratings are displayed in a small styled badge below the Netflix title controls.  
- A `MutationObserver` is used so the script updates automatically when you open a new title or a preview.

This way, the ratings always stay in sync with the content you‚Äôre watching.
